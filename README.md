# Melody of Life - A Music Sequencing Experiment based on Conway's Game of Life

Melody of Life is a variation of Conway's Game of Life, which is a zero player
cellular automata game.

In Melody of Life, each cell in the finite 20x20 grid corresponds to a note on
a pentatonic scale, interesting cellular patterns create interesting tonal
patterns.
